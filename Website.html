    <h3> Meet Vex </h3>
    <p> Name: Vex or Erina <br> Occupation: Student <br> Age: Minor <br> Pronouns: They/Them </p>
    <p>I am Vex, It's not my real name. <br> I am currently a student <br> I am interested in webdevelopment, Making 3D Models, Creating an AI, and web designing</p>
    <br>
    <p>For now as you can see, there's nothing in my portfolio, and just some simple information about me<br> To be completely honest, I know nothing about programming.<br> Yes the foundations were taught to me and stuff but in the end, I don't remember anything<br> So I'm starting from scratch. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Goodluck to me :3 </p>
